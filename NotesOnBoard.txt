to integrate turns again go to game.h -> virtual int makeMove() -> uncomment m_turn++;

Position is defined as Position(x,y). However, to properly index on the gameboard
the y is the rows and x is the columns IE if you want to get the piece in the 
second column, fourth row the position is "Position(4,2)"
