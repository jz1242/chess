DESIGN
To design our chess game we thought about how we could reuse functions for different pieces and thus made a checkValidRow and checkValidCol and checkValidDia that checks if the movement is horizontal or vertical or diagonal. And other checkMoveRow and CheckMoveCol and CheckMoveDia that see if there are pieces blocking a movement.
Besides this, we found that everything had to be hard coded and couldn't modularize any more.

COMPLETENESS
Our game is complete to the best of our knowledge.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
None.
